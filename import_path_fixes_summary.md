# Import Path Fixes Summary

## Fixed Import Path Issues

After the layered architecture restructure, the following import path issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. AppNavigation.vue

- **Issue**: Importing from `../router/routes`
- **Fix**: Changed to `../../router/routes`
- **Reason**: Component moved from `src/components/` to `src/app/components/`, requiring an extra level up

### 2. ErrorBoundary.vue

- **Issue**: Importing from `../utils/errorLogger`
- **Fix**: Changed to `../../utils/errorLogger`
- **Reason**: Component moved from `src/components/` to `src/app/components/`, requiring an extra level up

### 3. MortgageDetailDashboard.vue

- **Issue**: Importing from `../services/SimpleMortgageDataService`
- **Fix**: Changed to `../../services/SimpleMortgageDataService`
- **Reason**: Component moved from `src/components/` to `src/app/components/`, requiring an extra level up

### 4. CashFlowDashboard.view.vue

- **Issue**: Trying to import non-existent `createLocalStoragePortfolioRepository`
- **Fix**: Removed the import as it doesn't exist
- **Reason**: The repository is handled internally by PortfolioApplicationService

## Verified Correct Import Patterns

The following import patterns were verified and are correct:

### From app/components:

- `../../router/routes` - Access router
- `../../utils/*` - Access utilities
- `../../services/*` - Access services in src/services
- `../../stores/*` - Access stores
- `../../core/domain` - Access domain layer

### From app/views:

- `../services/application/services/*` - Access application services (same level)
- `../../router/routes` - Access router
- `../../core/domain` - Access domain layer
- `../../stores/*` - Access stores

### From app/adapters:

- `../services/application/services/*` - Access application services (same level)

## No Changes Required

The following files already had correct import paths:

- All files in `app/views/` importing from `../services/application/services/`
- All imports to `../../core/domain` from app directory
- All imports to `../../router/routes` from views
- All imports to `../../stores/` from views
